#Pokémon Card Tracker
An application designed to help Pokémon card collectors catalog and manage their collections efficiently.

#Core Features
 - Card Cataloging: This feature allows users to catalog their Pokémon cards by entering details such as card name, set, rarity, condition, and any special attributes. Users can also upload images of their cards for visual reference. The catalog is searchable and sortable, making it easy to find specific cards or sets.
 - Collection Management: This feature helps users manage their entire card collection by tracking quantities, trade status, and value. Users can mark cards as 'wanted' or 'for trade', and the app can provide estimated values based on current market trends. The collection overview provides insights into the total number of cards, sets completed, and overall collection value.
